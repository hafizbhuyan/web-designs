Creating designs from scratch for websites and web apps

I've been reliant on frameworks (Bootstrap), templates and CodePen
for all my website designs. This repo will be my way to work on
creating web designs on my own. I won't be creating the designs,
b/c I'm not a designer, but looking up really well designed sites
through Google and YouTube and doing my best to match the whole
site or a few of the designs on it.
